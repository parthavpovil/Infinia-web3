# Traffix - Road Safety Reporting DApp

## Overview
The **Traffix** is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to report road safety issues anonymously. Built using **React** and **Web3**, the application interacts with the blockchain to store reports securely. It uses **Metamask** for wallet connection and **IPFS** for image storage, providing a trustless and transparent platform for reporting.

### Key Features:
1. **Connect Wallet**: Users can connect their Metamask wallet to the app.
2. **Capture Image**: Users can take photos of road safety issues directly from their webcam.
3. **Add Details**: Provide additional information about the issue via a simple report form.
4. **Submit Report**: Submit the report to the blockchain, where it is stored securely and anonymously.
5. **View Reports**: View previously submitted reports and track ongoing issues within the community.


## Technologies Used:
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Web3.js**: For blockchain interaction and smart contract calls.
- **Metamask**: For wallet integration and blockchain authentication.
- **IPFS**: For decentralized image storage.
